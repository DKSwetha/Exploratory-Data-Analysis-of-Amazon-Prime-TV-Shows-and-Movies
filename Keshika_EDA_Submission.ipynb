        "With the rapid growth of online streaming platforms, understanding content performance and audience preferences has become essential for data-driven decision-making. This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Amazon Prime Video movies and TV shows dataset with the objective of extracting meaningful insights related to content distribution, trends over time, genre preferences, audience ratings, and popularity metrics. The dataset consists of two primary files: titles, which contains information about movies and TV shows, and credits, which provides cast and crew details. Together, these datasets offer a comprehensive view of the platform’s content library.\n",
        "\n",
        "The initial phase of the project involved data understanding and preprocessing. This included loading the datasets, inspecting their structure, handling missing values using context-based logic, removing duplicate records, validating data types, and converting list-like string columns such as genres and production countries into usable formats. Special care was taken when handling rating-related missing values to avoid introducing bias into the analysis. These steps ensured that the datasets were clean, consistent, and suitable for further exploration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Following data preparation, univariate analysis was performed to understand individual variables. This included analyzing the distribution of movies versus TV shows, release year trends, runtime patterns, genre frequencies, and rating distributions. The analysis revealed that Amazon Prime Video’s catalog is heavily dominated by movies, with TV shows forming a smaller portion. Content production was found to increase significantly after 2010, indicating a strong focus on recent releases. Drama, Comedy, and Action emerged as the most common genres, reflecting mainstream audience preferences.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bivariate analysis was then conducted to examine relationships between pairs of variables. Visualizations such as box plots, scatter plots, and line charts were used to analyze relationships between content type and ratings, runtime and ratings, and release year trends. These analyses showed that TV shows tend to have more consistent ratings compared to movies, while runtime and release year have minimal influence on audience ratings. This highlighted that content quality is not determined by duration or recency alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "To gain deeper insights, multivariate analysis techniques were applied, including scatter plots with multiple encodings, correlation heatmaps, and pair plots. The correlation analysis demonstrated strong agreement between IMDb and TMDB ratings, validating the use of ratings as reliable indicators of content quality. However, popularity metrics such as IMDb votes and TMDB popularity showed only moderate correlation with ratings, indicating that high popularity does not always imply high-quality content. The pair plot further confirmed weak relationships among most numerical variables, emphasizing that content success is influenced by multiple interacting factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this project demonstrates the value of exploratory data analysis in transforming raw streaming data into actionable business insights. The findings support informed decision-making related to content acquisition, recommendation strategies, genre prioritization, and regional expansion. By adopting a balanced and data-driven approach, Amazon Prime Video can enhance audience engagement, improve content quality perception, and strengthen its competitive position in the streaming market."

Most core attributes such as id, title, type, release_year, runtime, genres, and production_countries are almost 100% complete, indicating good data quality for content-level analysis. The description column has very low missing values (≈1%), meaning most titles are well documented. This makes the dataset reliable for analyzing content distribution, trends over time, and genre-based insights.\n",

The seasons column has the highest missing percentage (≈85%), which is expected because this attribute applies only to TV shows and not movies. The age_certification column has approximately 65% missing values, indicating that age ratings are not consistently available. Rating-related columns such as imdb_score, imdb_votes, and tmdb_score show moderate missingness, suggesting that not all titles have audience ratings or popularity metrics. These findings indicate that while the dataset is strong for descriptive analysis, some features may need to be excluded or handled carefully during further analysis.\n",

This completeness makes the dataset suitable for analyzing cast involvement, role distribution, and participation patterns across titles.\n",

        "The only column with missing values is character, which has approximately 13% missing data. This missingness is context-based and likely corresponds to non-acting roles such as directors, writers, or producers who do not portray characters. Since the remaining columns are fully populated, the dataset does not suffer from major data quality issues. Overall, the credits dataset complements the titles dataset well and enables extended analysis when merged, such as studying relationships between content type and cast participation."

        "The analysis shows that movies dominate the platform’s content library, accounting for more than 85% of the total titles, while TV shows form a relatively smaller share. To improve user retention and engagement, it is recommended that Amazon Prime Video increases its investment in high-quality TV shows, particularly limited series and multi-season originals. While movies can continue to be a core offering, a more balanced mix of movies and TV shows can enhance long-term subscriber engagement.\n",

        "2.Content Trends Over Time\n",
        "\n",
        "Content production has increased significantly after 2010, with a peak observed between 2015 and 2020. This indicates a strong shift toward recent content consumption. Amazon Prime Video should prioritize acquiring and producing newer content while selectively curating high-performing older titles based on ratings and popularity rather than release year alone. Maintaining consistent content releases over time can help sustain platform growth and viewer interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Genre-Based Content Strategy\n",
        "\n",
        "Drama, Comedy, and Action are the most common genres on the platform, while Crime and Thriller genres show relatively consistent audience ratings. It is recommended to continue investing in popular genres such as Drama but with a stronger focus on quality. Additionally, genres like Crime and Thriller can be leveraged to build a reputation for critically well-received content. Improving visibility and promotion of less popular titles within dominant genres can also enhance overall content utilization.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Country-wise and Regional Content Expansion\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset reveals that content production is dominated by a limited number of countries, indicating lower regional diversity. Amazon Prime Video should expand region-specific and local-language content to cater to diverse audiences. Increasing regional representation can support market expansion, attract new subscribers, and strengthen audience loyalty in underrepresented regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Audience Ratings and Quality Assessment\n",
        "\n",
        "IMDb and TMDB scores show strong consistency, making ratings a reliable indicator of content quality. However, popularity metrics such as IMDb votes do not strongly correlate with ratings, indicating that high viewership does not always imply high-quality content. It is recommended that Amazon Prime Video use ratings as a primary quality filter while treating popularity metrics as indicators of engagement rather than quality. Content length (runtime or number of seasons) should not be a deciding factor, as it has minimal impact on ratings.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Data-Driven Decision Support\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis indicates that no single variable strongly determines content success. Therefore, Amazon Prime Video should adopt a multi-factor decision-making framework that combines ratings, popularity, genre, and regional factors. This approach can improve content acquisition strategies, enhance recommendation systems, and support informed business decisions. Care should also be taken when handling missing data to avoid bias in future analytical models."
